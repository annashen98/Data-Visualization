## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **Xuancheng City**, located in the southeast of Anhui Province, as a case study for transport network analysis. Xuancheng has experienced **rapid urban expansion** due to its advantageous location in the **Yangtze River Delta economic zone**, making it an ideal setting for exploring the relationship between transport infrastructure and urbanisation.  

Studies have shown that transport infrastructure plays a crucial role in shaping urbanisation processes in China, strongly influencing spatial development in cities of different sizes (Liu & Su, 2021). In line with recent approaches in Chinese urban transport network research (Tung et al., 2024), this project applies **complex network theory** to analyse Xuancheng’s transportation system.

## 📂 Data Sources  
We integrate multiple datasets to study Xuancheng’s transportation network:  
- **Road Network Topology**: 578 road segments.  
- **Loop Detector Data**: Captures real-time traffic flow.  
- **Floating Car Trajectories**: Data from 500 commercial vehicles.  
- **Holographic Traffic Data**: Based on Wang et al. (2022).  
- **Resampling Methodology**: Data pre-processing following Wang et al. (2023).

## 🔬 Methodology  
- Apply **complex network theory** to evaluate the structural properties of Xuancheng’s road network.  
- Combine **topological analysis** with **dynamic traffic flow data** to capture both infrastructure and real-time usage.  
- Use **floating car trajectories** to model traffic dynamics and detect mobility patterns.  
- Integrate findings to provide insights into:  
  - Network efficiency  
  - Bottleneck identification  
  - Potential planning strategies for sustainable growth
